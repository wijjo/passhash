    <h1>Frequently-Asked Questions:</h1>

    <h2>Am I really improving my security or just saving effort?</h2>
    <p>
    It depends.  It should improve the security of most users by easing the
    burden of using strong and varied passwords.  On the other hand, if you are
    highly disciplined and aware of security needs you may actually increase
    your vulnerability by exposing more sites to intrusion if a master key is
    stolen.  Of course the hacker will only be successful if he knows to use
    this tool to regenerate hash words.  If you're reusing passwords already
    this tool should only help.
    </p>

    <h2>What if I need to log in and this tool isn't available?</h2>
    <p>
    You can generate a Portable Page to load and run in any browser when this
    extension is unavailable.  You can also use the
    <a href="http://wijjo.com/passhash/passhash.html" target="_content">
    online tool</a> to generate identical hash words, but it won't know your
    site tags and settings.  See the <a href="portable.html">Portable</a> help
    page for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
    The page fits nicely in a Firefox sidebar for extra convenience.  It is
    also completely self-contained, so you can move the one HTML file to other
    storage devices, including USB keys.  page as a single self-contained file
    and store it on a USB key.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please be aware that the extra hash word filtering and size options make
    this tool incompatible with other similar tools, e.g.
    <a href=http://hashapass.com/ target="_content">Hashapass</a>, which may
    generate different results, depending on which options your are using.
    </p>

    <h2>Should I record the generated hash words somewhere?</h2>
    <p>
    It's not a bad idea, but if you save a Portable Page as backup you have
    everything but the master key(s).  So it's up to you.  An additional
    locked-up "dead tree" or electronic copy is an extra measure of safety, in
    case you need to manually enter the hash words someday.  You can also use a
    program like <a href="http://keepass.sourceforge.net" target="_content">
    KeePass</a> (highly recommended for Windows users) to save your data in an
    encrypted file.
    </p>
    <p>
    Just give a bit of thought to all the scenarios of dying or borrowed
    computers and broken software. :)
    </p>

    <h2>Do I have to remember the options set for each site?</h2>
    <p>
    Not normally.  The tool remembers it for you.  But if you lose the saved
    data, e.g. by clearing the Firefox password cache, you need to reproduce
    the default settings and the overrides for individual sites.  Hopefully you
    won't have so many special cases that remembering is a problem.
    </p>

    <h2>Where is the data stored?</h2>
    <p>
    Everything is stored in the Firefox password cache.  It's encrypted and
    secure.  You can use extensions like the
    <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2848" target="_content">
    Password Exporter</a> to save this cached data for backup or to transfer
    it to another machine.
    </p>

    <h2>How can I change the shortcut key?</h2>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to <strong>about:config</strong> using location bar.</li>
        <li>Filter on passhash and look for
        <strong>passhash.optShortcutKeyCode</strong> and
        <strong>passhash.optShortcutKeyMods</strong>.</li>
        <li>Set <strong>passhash.optShortcutKeyCode</strong> either to one of
        the virtual keys using <strong>VK_</strong> as a prefix, e.g.
        <strong>VK_F6</strong> or to a displayable key using the actual
        character, e.g. <strong>h</strong> or <strong>;</strong>.</li>
        <li>Set <strong>passhash.optShortcutKeyMods</strong> to one or more
        space-separated key modifiers. <strong>accel</strong> is a
        cross-platform modifier which is the Control key on PCs and the Command
        key on Macs. You can also use <strong>alt</strong>,
        <strong>control</strong>, <strong>shift</strong>, and
        combinations.</li>
        <li>Restart Firefox.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <h4>Control-Alt-H</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>passhash.optShortcutKeyCode</strong> = <strong>h</strong></li>
        <li><strong>passhash.optShortcutKeyMods</strong> = <strong>control alt</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Control-; (PC) and Command-; (Mac)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>passhash.optShortcutKeyCode</strong> = <strong>;</strong></li>
        <li><strong>passhash.optShortcutKeyMods</strong> = <strong>accel</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Control-F12 (PC) and Command-F12 (Mac)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>passhash.optShortcutKeyCode</strong> = <strong>VK_F12</strong></li>
        <li><strong>passhash.optShortcutKeyMods</strong> = <strong>accel</strong></li>
    </ul>
