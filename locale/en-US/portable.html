    <h1>The Portable Page</h1>
    <p>
    You can generate a Portable Page to load and run in any browser when this
    extension is unavailable.  It is similar to the
    <a href="http://wijjo.com/passhash/passhash.html" target="_content">online tool</a>,
    but also knows your site tags and per-site option settings.
    </p>
    <p>
    When you select one of your site tags in the drop-down list at the top it
    applies the appropriate options.  The site tags and options known to the page
    represent a snapshot of what had been saved by the Password Hasher
    extension prior to generating the page.  It serves as a useful of backup
    for your site tags and options.  For security, the master key(s) are never
    saved in the page.
    </p>
    <p>
    Make copies of the generated file to place on USB keys, servers, and other
    systems.  You'll be able to log in from anywhere, whether or not the Password
    Hasher is installed, and whether or not you're running Firefox.
