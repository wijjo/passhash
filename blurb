What good security practice demands:

* Strong passwords that are hard to guess.
* Different passwords at each site.
* Periodically changing existing passwords.

Why you probably aren't practicing good security:

* Strong passwords are difficult to remember.
* Juggling a multitude of passwords is a pain.
* Updating passwords compounds the memorization problem.

How Password Hasher helps:

* The same master key produces different passwords at many sites.
* You can quickly upgrade passwords by "bumping" the site tag.
* You can upgrade the master key without updating all sites at once.
* It supports different length passwords.
* It supports special requirements, such as digit and punctuation characters.
* All data is saved to the browser's secure password database.
* It's extremely simple to use!
